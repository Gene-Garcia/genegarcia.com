      "Shakey's operates in both the fast-food and the restaurant industry, where the company achieved having the highest market share in both industries. Shakey's Philippines is only a franchise of Shakey's from Sacramento, California, that initially aimed to promote beers. Today, its brand is well known to provide excellent quality of both food and service to Filipino families and groups. The purpose of this case study is to evaluate the performance of Shakey's through a business plan review and performing a SWOT analysis. Notably, the advent of information technology has reshaped how businesses worldwide operate, especially during and after this COVID-19 pandemic. The area of artificial intelligence and its application to business operations has also been a trend in identifying and creating improved or re-engineered overall business operations. Informed decision-making is critical for Shakey's Philippines to maintain both its brand and customer base, acquire a competitive advantage against the competitive food market, and overall better decision-making in improving its operations. This case study has proposed 2 business analytics solutions for improving Shakey's customer monitoring and intervention and human resource management. Business analytics solutions come with both functional and non-functional requirements that Shakey's must handle. The case study recommended following the de facto standard for data mining, CRISP-DM, and integrating with project management life cycles, such as waterfall and agile methodology.",

      "Cloud computing is an innovation that changed how data and resources are stored and accessed through the internet. The term cloud has been jargon which means a virtual storage space to store data. However, the cloud is just like any IT infrastructure but is remotely hosted and maintained by cloud providers. Cloud computing has three known models, that is, software-as-a-service (SaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and platform-as-a-service (PaaS). Enterprises and even small businesses have moved towards the cloud. As a result, companies can have state-of-the-art IT infrastructure without having to purchase and maintain any physical infrastructure, but only a cloud provider subscription. Prominently, cloud migration initiatives and investments are brought about by the scalability and flexibility of the cloud, which makes it cost-effective than traditional IT infrastructure. Challenges and problems arise with the traditional IT infrastructure. There will be instances when traditional IT infrastructure will be upgraded but would be cost-ineffective when not utilized. The same goes for insufficient infrastructure capacity and power, but with large numbers of data and resources, such as Big Data.",

      "The Philippine government, along with its executive department, has sought to build a technology-enabled governing nation, which drives socio-economic development and overall improvement in public service delivery. Local Government Units has started to deploy technology solutions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of management and delivery. The study aims to design an incident reporting web application for barangay Sinisian, a barangay in the town of Calaca, province of Batangas. Incident reporting is part of the katarungang pambarangay or the barangay justice system, as mandated by the RA 7160 or the 1991 Local Government Code of the Philippines, which amicably settle disputes within the community to promote peace, justice, and harmonious relationship. The web application digitalizes the complete management of katarungang pambarangay records, specifically, records used in the acquisition of incident reports, notices for individuals, and settlements. Additionally, the design of web applications upholds the protection and integrity data of katarungang pambarangay records from unauthorized and unauthenticated access.",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic posed a great threat, not only to the health of the people but also to the health of the economy and businesses. The objectives of this paper are to review and determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and organization’s operation. Additionally, it also aims to identify action plans that support the recovery from the pandemic. This paper used a narrative literature review as a research methodology to gather timely and relevant resources, which draw insights and knowledge from the literature. The underlying factors of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically, government measures, are causing the disruption and changes in the economic activity of every country and business. It was observed that the government measures, as a response to the pandemic, consequently resulted in the decline of businesses’ financial performance through low consumer demands, buying power, and limited resources. For instance, limiting the outdoor movements and access to non-essentials, as government response, consequently resulted in the decline of businesses’ sales profit and revenues. Some organizations, however, implemented crisis management protocols and policies to survive and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. A Study about the businesses’ performance during this pandemic identified models and constructs related to survivability and resilience as crisis management. This paper then summarized the information into a crisis management model that is seen to improve the performance and recovery of the businesses from the impact of the pandemic. Additionally, this paper also introduced a model of the COVID-19 impact that was identified in the organizations’ experiences. These models can provide relevant information about the pandemic and initiate preparedness. Furthermore, contribute support to the businesses’ crisis management initiatives to thrive and recover from the hostile business and financial environment brought by crises, such as this COVID-19 pandemic.",

The study determines the perception of Mamatid residence and uniform personnel of Bureau of Fire Protection, Philippine National Police and Ospital ng Cabuyao towards the use of smartphone applications for emergency hotlines. The researchers gathered data from ten Mamatid residents and five from uniform personnel. The researchers used the demographic profile, age, and sex, for both respondents; furthermore, past experience of Mamatid residence was used to analyze their perception. It was found that there was no significant implication of past experience to the perception. However, there were significant effects of sex and age on the perception of the respondents.",
